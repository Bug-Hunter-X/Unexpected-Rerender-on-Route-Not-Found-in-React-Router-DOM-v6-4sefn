This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router DOM v6 where navigating to a non-existent route causes unintended rerenders of other components.  The bug is particularly noticeable when those components have state that needs to persist. The solution uses `useLocation` to prevent unnecessary rerenders.  This is a common issue when transitioning between various routes and is particularly relevant when dealing with complex state management within your application.
